# Email System Code Explanation

This Python program simulates a simple email system with **users**, **inboxes**, and **emails**, including features like sending, reading, listing, and deleting emails.

---

## 1. `Email` Class

The `Email` class represents an individual email message.

### Attributes
- `sender` – The `User` object sending the email.
- `receiver` – The `User` object receiving the email.
- `subject` – The subject line of the email.
- `body` – The main content of the email.
- `timestamp` – Automatically records the date and time when the email was created using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
- `read` – Boolean to indicate if the email has been read. Defaults to `False`.

### Methods
- `mark_as_read()`  
  Marks the email as read by setting `read = True`.

- `display_full_email()`  
  Prints the full details of the email (sender, receiver, subject, timestamp, and body) and marks it as read.

- `__str__()`  
  Returns a short summary of the email for listing purposes, showing read/unread status, sender, subject, and timestamp.

---

## 2. `Inbox` Class

The `Inbox` class represents a user's inbox containing all received emails.

### Attributes
- `emails` – A list that stores all `Email` objects received by the user.

### Methods
- `receive_email(email)`  
  Adds a new `Email` object to the `emails` list.

- `list_emails()`  
  Lists all emails in the inbox with enumeration. Prints “Your inbox is empty” if there are no emails.

- `read_email(index)`  
  Reads and displays the full content of an email by its index in the inbox. Validates the index before access.

- `delete_email(index)`  
  Deletes an email at the specified index after validating it. Prints confirmation upon deletion.

---

## 3. `User` Class

The `User` class represents a system user who can send and receive emails.

### Attributes
- `name` – The name of the user.
- `inbox` – Each user has their own `Inbox` object to store received emails.

### Methods
- `send_email(receiver, subject, body)`  
  Creates a new `Email` object and sends it to the receiver's inbox. Prints confirmation of the sent email.

- `check_inbox()`  
  Prints the list of emails in the user's inbox using `Inbox.list_emails()`.

- `read_email(index)`  
  Reads a specific email from the inbox by calling `Inbox.read_email(index)`.

- `delete_email(index)`  
  Deletes a specific email from the inbox by calling `Inbox.delete_email(index)`.

---

## 4. Main Function

The `main()` function demonstrates the system in action:

```python
tory = User('Tory')
ramy = User('Ramy')        

# Tory sends an email to Ramy
tory.send_email(ramy, 'Hello', 'Hi Ramy, just saying hello!')

# Ramy replies to Tory
ramy.send_email(tory, 'Re: Hello', 'Hi Tory, hope you are fine.')
```

---

### What Happens

1. Two users are created: Tory and Ramy.
2. Tory sends an email to Ramy → added to Ramy’s inbox → confirmation printed.
3. Ramy replies to Tory → added to Tory’s inbox → confirmation printed.

---

## 5. Program Execution

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
- Ensures that main() runs only when the script is executed directly.
- Sets up the user simulation and email exchange.

---

## Key Features Implemented

- Email creation with timestamp and read/unread status
- Inbox management: receive, list, read, delete emails
- Users can send emails to each other
- User-friendly output with confirmation messages and full email display
