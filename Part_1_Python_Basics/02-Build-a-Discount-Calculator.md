# Build a Discount Calculator

In this lab, you will write a function that calculates the final price of an item after applying a percentage discount.

For example, if the price of an item is 50 and a discount of 20 is applied, the discount amount is 10, and the final price is 40.

## User Stories

- You should define a function named `apply_discount`.

- The `apply_discount` function should take exactly two parameters: `price` and `discount`.

- If `price` is not a number (`int` or `float`), the function should return the string:
  
  `The price should be a number`

- If `discount` is not a number (`int` or `float`), the function should return the string:
  
  `The discount should be a number`

- If `price` is less than or equal to 0, the function should return the string:
  
  `The price should be greater than 0`

- If `discount` is less than 0 or greater than 100, the function should return the string:
  
  `The discount should be between 0 and 100`

- If both inputs are valid, the function should calculate the discount as a percentage of the price.

- The function should return the final price after applying the discount.

# CODE

```python
def apply_discount(price, discount):
    # Validate price type
    if not isinstance(price, (int, float)):
        return "The price should be a number"
    
    # Validate discount type
    if not isinstance(discount, (int, float)):
        return "The discount should be a number"
    
    # Validate price value
    if price <= 0:
        return "The price should be greater than 0"
    
    # Validate discount range (percentage)
    if not 0 <= discount <= 100:
        return "The discount should be between 0 and 100"
    
    # Calculate discounted price
    discount_amount = price * (discount / 100)
    final_price = price - discount_amount
    
    return final_price
```
